React Hooks Best Practices

React hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.

Key Hooks:

1. useState - Manages component state
   - Returns a stateful value and a function to update it
   - Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

2. useEffect - Handles side effects
   - Runs after render
   - Can return a cleanup function
   - Dependencies array controls when it runs

3. useCallback - Memoizes functions
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders
   - Useful for passing functions to child components

4. useMemo - Memoizes computed values
   - Caches expensive calculations
   - Only recomputes when dependencies change

Best Practices:

- Always call hooks at the top level of your component
- Never call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
- Use dependency arrays correctly in useEffect
- Clean up subscriptions and timers in useEffect cleanup
- Use useCallback and useMemo to optimize performance
- Custom hooks should start with "use"

Performance Tips:

- Avoid creating objects/arrays in render
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Split large components into smaller ones
- Use code splitting for large applications
